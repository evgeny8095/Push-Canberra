Mobile Canberra is a powerful platform for showing points of interest and services around Canberra. 

The app provides access to geolocational Government datasets and services. Current services include bus stops, 
public toilets, playgrounds, libraries, TAFE campuses, schools, public art, and public furniture. Additional services will be loaded onto the app as they become available. 

The services are available from [http://www.data.act.gov.au/](http://www.data.act.gov.au/)
